								<h3>where the pencil meets technology</h3>
								<p>My passion has always been art, I love pushing concepts further than what is expected. I like working with people to gather ideas to build something extraordinary. One of my favorite mediums I still fall back to, is traditional graphite. I usually fall back on traditional art to gain quick layouts or sketches that get rendered into final pieces. I use traditional sketches primarily because I've worked them for so many years. </p>

								<p>What has been really interesting is being able to combine traditional art with digital mediums. What has helped me a lot  is having a really good foundation in design and art to able to input that into a digital format that produces amazing results. The best work I've completed is when I utilize both techniques traditional and digital.</p>

								<h3>Front End fear</h3>
								<p>I got involed with front-end developing when I was really immersing myself in graphic design. I wanted to take art a step further. Front-end developing does that because they are the real sketch artists behind the screens when it comes to computers.  </p>

								<p>One big fear I had when I was learning how to code was messing things up. I didn,t want to break anything I could not fix but I needed to overcome that fear otherwise I would never learn. I ended up overcoming that fear by not giving up until I achieved the results, I wanted no matter how long it took. After overcoming this fear, it has allowed me to see the endless possibilities that can be done with front end development. </p>
